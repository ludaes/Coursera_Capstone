Reducing traffic accidents is an important public safety challenge around the world. 
Currently the amount of car accidents has raised despite the efforts of Seattle government to stop them. 
Thus, the Seattle government is enabling safer routes and cost-effectively improving the transportation infrastructure, all in order to make the roads safer [1]. 

The results of the model provide advices for the stakeholders to make decisions about reducing the accident severity given the current weather, road and visibility conditions. 
The stakeholders are local Seattle government, police, and car insurance institutes. 
The target audience of the project are people who drive a car.
